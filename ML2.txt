O say, can you VERB, by the dawn`s early NOUN, What so ADVERB we hail`d at the twilight`s last VERBING ? Whose ADJ stripes and bright SHAPE, thro` the perilous NOUN, O`er the ramparts we VERBED, were so gallantly streaming? And the NOUN `s ADJ glare, the bombs VERBING in air, Gave BODPART thro` the night that our NOUN was still there. O say, does that SHAPE -spangled banner yet VERB . O`er the land of the ADJ and the NOUN of the ADJ .
